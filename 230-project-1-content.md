This game will be developed for a desktop environment for the user to play on. However, the controls should
be simple enough that a mobile-friendly version may be possible.

## IV. Story
You're fighting in a space war where you are the ace pilot of your army. The enemy has surrounded you and
you must be able to stand your ground as much as you can.

### Mechanics
The player will control their ship in the main screen of the page, moving using the WASD standard, and using
the mouse to change their orientation, aim, and shoot. There will be waves of enemies coming at you, with
each level increasing the firing rate, and amount of enemies that spawn.

### Control
The game will primarly be controlled using keyboard and mouse.

### Onboarding
The player will be taught the game through onscreen prompts as the game begins. The first wave will be slow,
so they will have time to 

### Player learning
As the game goes on, the player will learn what they need to do to win the game: stay alive. There will be a counter
indicating the numbered wave they have, and GUI showing what kind of weapons they have (default is laser, but can switch to bombs to
destroy larger groups).
